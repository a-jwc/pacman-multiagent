Description:
For the relflex agent, I initially wrote a much more complicated implementation that only achieved a 3/4 score. After deliberation with my peers, I implemented a much simpler algorithm, which also found success when implemented in betterEvaluationFunction.

The majority of my time (>36 hours) was spent trying to debug minimax. I referred to mulitple different resources to implement this, including pseudocode from the book, slides, stackoverflow, and a youtube video. Much of my time was spent trying to fix an error that ultimately turned out to be an "off by 1" error involving a maximizer being included twice in the tree. After fixing this error with the help of my peer, the following questions (expectimax and betterEvaluationFunction) were solved in a relatively short amount of time.

Hours spent:
I spend less time on this assignment than the previous assignment.
